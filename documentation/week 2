Week 2

We focused on applying data cleaning techniques using Python and comparing Python with Power BI for data preparation and visualization tasks.

Data cleaning with Python 
- Used for automation 
- Suitable for large datasets 

Difference between Python and PowerBi
Python: Automation(can reuse the code)
PowerBI: Visualization

String:Set of characters ,any number which are not used in computation also
Example: phone number is considered as a text
Few phone numbers start with zero,when loading the data zero vanishes

Learned about :
libraries,dataframe,drop duplicates,strip,standradisation of Y/N,Nan,N/a ,etc.

Data Cleaning Operations in Python
- Loading dataset  
- Handling missing values  
- Dropping duplicates  
- Formatting text columns  
- Standardizing categorical values
