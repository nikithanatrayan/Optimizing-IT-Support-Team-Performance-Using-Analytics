Week 7 & 8 

Data Visualization & Storytelling

We focused on how to design effective and meaningful dashboards that communicate insights clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Visualization:
   Visualization is not decorative — it must interpret data clearly.
   Use consistent colors (each color should represent a specific category).
   Always compare one category with another for better understanding.
   Measures and columns serve different purposes and must be used appropriately.
   Choose visuals based on the question you are trying to answer.

Choosing the Right Visual:
   Bar chart → Category comparison
   Histogram → Data distribution and spread
   Box plot → Identify range, quartiles, and extreme values
   Pie chart → Proportion (use minimally)
   Time series chart → Trend over time


Box plot components:
   Lower limit (min)
   Upper limit (max)
   Quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%)
   Whiskers for range
   Helps detect extreme values (outliers)

Dashboard Planning
Before building a dashboard:
1. Decide how many dashboards you need.
2. Define the question each dashboard answers.
3. Keep dashboards focused and specific.

Each dashboard should:
  Have a clear and meaningful title (first impression for stakeholders).
  Provide a quick glance overview.
  Show how the data works together.

Layout & Structure
  Divide the dashboard into quadrants .
  Maintain proper alignment and spacing.
  Start with the most important visual (usually KPI cards).
  Place key insights at the center/top for visibility.


KPI Cards
  2–3 KPI cards only
  Show most valuable insights
  Simple and easy to read
  Bold and clear


Design & Formatting
  Use the format pane to style visuals.
  Keep the design minimal and clean.
  Add legends where necessary.
  Use interactive slicers for better exploration.
  Can enhance appearance by:
      Adjusting visual formatting
      Changing canvas background
      Applying a consistent theme


 Art of Storytelling with Data:
    Follow a flow from one visual to another.
    Maintain connection between visuals.
    Do not break the narrative sequence.
    Arrange content in a meaningful order.
