week 6

We focused more on DAX functions
DAX - The brain of PowerBI
    - To summarise data for better view
    - For implementing DAX function ,we need tables with relation
    - Used to create measures
    - Used to perform calculations

Measures in Power BI
       -Are created using DAX
       -Calculate measurable (numeric) values
       -Are not part of the table

Creating a Measure
      - Use New Measure option
      - Measures are written using DAX expressions

Why to Use Measures
         - Allow better control over calculations
         - Improve report performance
         - Can be reused across multiple visuals

Types of Measures
        - Base measure : Created from a column from the table.
        - composite measure : Created using two different measures.

CALCULATE Function
          - Allows applying filters inside a measure
          - Used to calculate values under conditions
          -Is one of the most important DAX functions

CALCULATE Syntax
     CALCULATE(expression,[filter1],[filter2])

Slicers
    - Are interactive filters
    = Used in report view
    - Allow users to select values

Conditional Logic is used for decision making
IF : Executes a block of logic only when the condition is TRUE.
IF ELSE: Executes one block when the condition is TRUE, and executes the ELSE block when the condition is FALSE.
Nested IF: Uses multiple IF conditions, checked one after another, to handle multiple scenarios.
