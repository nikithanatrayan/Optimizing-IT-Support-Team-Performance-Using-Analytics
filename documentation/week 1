Week 1
Started off the project by learning importance of data cleaning.
Raw data contains missing values,duplicates,null,etc.
Data cleaning helps in better visualization and analysis.
The process include :
    Collecting the data(excel,csv,databases),
    Transform(extracting the data and clean it),
    Visualize
Python : To clean the data ,automation
PowerBI: Visualize
Learned about the power query
Common cleaning steps include:
  -setting correct data types
  -removing null values
  -splitting columns
  -trimming the extra spaces
  -standardizing data
  -remove duplicates

Views in PowerBI:
1.Table view: to check the data 
2.Model view: to understand the relationships
3.Report view: to create visualizations


Reports (static) and Dashboards(interactive)
Time series: Use Line chart


Task: collect data based on IT support tickets and understand the data


Presentation (final part)
1.Documentation
2.Upload files to github
3.Interactive dashboards-"optimal dashbords"
