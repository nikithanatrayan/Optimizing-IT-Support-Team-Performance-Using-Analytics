Week 1

Started off the project by learning importance of data cleaning.
Raw datasets contains missing values,duplicates,null,etc.


Data cleaning ensures:
- Accurate analysis  
- Reliable visualizations  
- Better decision making

The process include :
   1. Data Collection: Collecting the data(excel,csv,databases).
   2. Data Transformation: Transform(extracting the data and clean it).
   3. Data Visualization: Visualize.


Tools 
-Python : To clean the data ,automation
-PowerBI: Visualize,data transformation

Learned about the power query
Common cleaning steps include:
  -setting correct data types
  -removing null values
  -splitting columns
  -trimming the extra spaces
  -standardizing data
  -remove duplicates

Views in PowerBI:
1.Table view: To check the data,displays the actual data stored in table after cleaning. 
2.Model view: To understand the relationships,manage realtionships and schema design shows how tables are connected.
3.Report view: To create visualizations and understand data visually.


Reports (static analysis) and Dashboards(interactive monitoring)
Time series: Use Line chart


Task: collect data based on IT support tickets and understand the data


Presentation (final part)
1.Documentation
2.Upload files to github
3.Interactive dashboards-"optimal dashbords"
