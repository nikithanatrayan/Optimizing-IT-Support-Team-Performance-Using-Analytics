# Optimizing IT Support Team Performance Using Analytics

##  🔹Problem Statement
   Customer support teams manage thousands of service tickets daily, making it difficult to monitor response efficiency, identify recurring issues, and maintain service quality.
This project analyzes customer support ticket data to evaluate operational performance, identify problem sources, and provide actionable insights for improving support efficiency and customer experience.

Organizations often lack visibility into:
   -->How quickly support teams respond to customers

   -->Which issues generate the highest workload

   -->Products or channels causing operational delays
This project aims to:

  --> Measure support performance using key KPIs

   -->Identify recurring issue patterns

  --> Support data-driven decision making
