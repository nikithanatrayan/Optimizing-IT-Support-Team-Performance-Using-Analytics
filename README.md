# Optimizing IT Support Team Performance Using Analytics

## Problem Statement
   IT support teams handle a large number of tickets daily,making it difficult to track performance and recurring issues.This project aims at analyzing support ticket data to improve efficiency and overall team performance.
## Dataset Description
   Dataset: IT support ticket dataset
   
   Source: kaggle
   
   Dataset description:The dataset consists of customer support tickets generated by users interacting with an IT service desk or customer support platform. Each record represents a single support interaction containing information about the ticket subject, type of issue, priority level, language, system version, and categorical tags describing the issue
   
Feature Description:

Subject:A short textual summary of the customer’s issue or request. It provides quick context about the problem being reported.

Incident Type:Indicates the nature of the ticket, such as Incident, Request, or Problem. This helps classify tickets based on urgency and 
complexity.

Priority:Represents the urgency level of the ticket (e.g., High, Medium, Low). This feature is critical for understanding response strategies.

Version:Specifies the product or system version associated with the ticket. Useful for identifying version-specific issues or recurring problems.

Language:Indicates the language used by the customer when submitting the ticket. This helps analyze multilingual support requirements and team readiness.

Tag 1 – Tag 4:Categorical labels describing the issue in more detail (e.g., Security, Billing, Feature, Feedback). Tags enable deeper issue classification and trend analysis.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The following KPIs were used to evaluate and optimize IT support performance:

Number of tickets by priority level

Ticket distribution by incident type

Issue frequency by tag category

Language wise ticket volume

Version wise ticket occurrence

High priority incident concentration



   
## Dashboard


  
## Key Insights

High priority tickets are mostly associated with incidents rather than service requests.

Certain tags such as security, outages, and billing appear frequently, indicating recurring operational issues.

Specific system versions generate more tickets, suggesting stability or usability concerns.

English language tickets dominate, but multilingual support remains important for global users.

Tag based categorization reveals patterns that are not obvious from priority alone.


  
## Recommendations
   Live Data Integration:This would enable real time dashboards,automatic updates and continuous performance monitoring.


## Tools Used

  Python – Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
  
  Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation and preprocessing
  
  Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation and KPI visualization
